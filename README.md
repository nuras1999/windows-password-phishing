> Get windows admin password by Phishing 

## Overview
- We have a habit of entering our admin password whenever windows security manager requests. What if, we create such GUI request and make someone enter their password thinking that its from system firewall. _Great right!_ 
- This creates GUI alert window and requests for user password. 
- Until password is entered the alertbox cannot be closed.
- For checking correctness, it is programmed in such a way that the first entered is password is always shown as wrong.
- This is because the user enters right password for the second time thinking the first password is mistakenly typed.
- Both the entered passwords are stored in a textfile at the given location.
